Step1: 
    pip3 install:
        numpy
        pandas
        keras
        sklearn
    or you could run:
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Step2:
    (make sure you didn't move the ./data folder/directory)
    
Step3:
    run python3 main.py

Note:
    - If the MODEL_TYPE constant is equal to 1, it takes around 2 minutes
    to train the model and execute the whole program.
    - It is possible to lower the C_VALUE_FOR_SVM constant
    to ~500 at create_model.py for faster executation with lower model
    score.
